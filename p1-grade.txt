## Grade: 91/100

- [30 pts] Make concurrent (ABET outcome 1) - 30
  - [10 pts] You got a speedup of at least 2 with 4 or more cores 
  - [10 pts] mytests.c accepts a number of threads as a command line argument
  - [10 pts] Correctly creates new threads

- [30 pts] Implementation analysis (speedup.pdf ABET outcome 6) - 30
  - Score will reflect the quality of the analysis.

- [10 pts] Code quality for **lab.c**
  - [4 pts] Code is formatted correctly and follows a consistent style
  - [2 pts] Code is commented when necessary
  - [4 pts] There is more than just the main function in **mytests.c**

- [20 pts] Compiler warnings **ALL files** - 11: 3 warnings
  - Each compiler warning will result in a 3 point deduction.
  - You are not allowed to suppress warnings
  - You must build with the flags ```-Wall -Wextra -Wpointer-arith -Wstrict-prototypes -std=gnu89```

- [10 pts] Valgrind reports no memory leaks or read/write errors - 10
  - As reported by **runval.sh**
  - This is a **PASS/FAIL** score. 1 read/write error or leaking 1
    byte will result in a zero for this section. There is no partial
    credit for this section.
